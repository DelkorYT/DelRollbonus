# Commands

drbsync takes the number of the raid as an argument, i.e. 1 or 3. It then sends the attendance bonus-data via addon message.

```
/drbsync <raid>
```

drbmc takes the number of the raid as an argument, i.e. 1 or 3. It then saves the character to that raid so it can access the data when acting as lootmaster.

```
/drbmc <raid>
```

# Usage

Either use Gargul's integrated feature to roll out loot and DRB will hook into those raidmessages or you can send "start" or "stop" into raidchat to reset the roll-table / print the current roll-table
